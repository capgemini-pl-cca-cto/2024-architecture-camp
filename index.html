            Software Architecture
            <p>
              Architecture refers to the overall structure and organization of a
              software system. It defines the components, relationships, and
              interactions between them, as well as the principles and
              guidelines for designing and building the system.

              Agile is a shift that seeks to contain complexity by reducing
              irreversibility. One of an architect's most important tasks is to
              <b class="primary-color">remove architecture</b> by finding ways
              to eliminate irreversibility in software designs

                  The mantra of Agile Architecture is that the architecture must
                  always be in sync with the code.
                  <span class="primary-color">`Everything as code`</span> is a
                  commonly adopted principle by Agile and DevOps practitioners
                  and useful for Agile Architecture. It consists in applying the
                  same techniques used to manage source code (reviewing,
                  versioning, branching, configuration control) to all the other
                  aspects related to software development: infrastructure,
                  environment provisioning, architecture itself, DevOps
                  pipelines and also
